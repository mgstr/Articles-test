Although <span class='empty' id='1' /> New Orleans Saints' offense put up a whopping 577 yards in their 49-24 victory over <span class='empty' id='2' /> New York Giants on Monday night, <span class='empty' id='3' /> game's biggest play came courtesy of a very unlikely suspect: backup linebacker Will Herring.</p><p>Herring made a terrific interception in <span class='empty' id='4' /> end zone to snuff out <span class='empty' id='5' /> Giants' first drive when <span class='empty' id='6' /> game was scoreless. New York tight end Jake Ballard had a step on Herring, but quarterback Eli Manning didn't have enough steam on his pass, and Herring reached up to snag it.</p><p>It was just <span class='empty' id='7' /> sixth interception and 10th takeaway of <span class='empty' id='8' /> season for <span class='empty' id='9' /> Saints' defense, which entered <span class='empty' id='10' /> game ranked last in <span class='empty' id='11' /> NFL in both categories. Later in <span class='empty' id='12' /> game, Saints cornerback Tracy Porter forced a fumble that was recovered by safety Roman Harper. <span class='empty' id='13' /> Saints also forced three other fumbles that were recovered by <span class='empty' id='14' /> Giants.</p><p>Herring's play made <span class='empty' id='15' /> biggest impact when momentum was still up for grabs. <span class='empty' id='16' /> Saints' opening drive had ended with a deflating fake field-goal attempt that fell 2 yards short. Then <span class='empty' id='17' /> Giants nearly marched 90 yards for a quick touchdown before Herring got in <span class='empty' id='18' /> way.</p><p>It was a huge moment for <span class='empty' id='19' /> fifth-year veteran, who hadn't done much since signing with <span class='empty' id='20' /> Saints as a free agent from Seattle in July. Herring started at strongside linebacker in Week 1 but fell behind Scott Shanle, Jo-Lonn Dunbar and Jonathan Casillas in <span class='empty' id='21' /> pecking order at outside linebacker. Then he missed five games with a hamstring injury.</p><p>"You know, that's football, " Herring said of dealing with <span class='empty' id='22' /> injury. "I've been thankful <span class='empty' id='23' /> coaching staff has stuck with me. Joe Vitt has been encouraging, telling me just to keep my head up and keep preparing."</p><p>A week after <span class='empty' id='24' /> Saints allowed six sacks at St. Louis last month, guard Carl Nicks said <span class='empty' id='25' /> Saints had given up so many sacks that day that they couldn't afford to give up another one for <span class='empty' id='26' /> rest of <span class='empty' id='27' /> year.</p><p>Who knew he was being literal?</p><p>For <span class='empty' id='28' /> third straight game, <span class='empty' id='29' /> Saints didn't allow a sack as <span class='empty' id='30' /> offensive line continues to try to erase <span class='empty' id='31' /> haunting memory from that St. Louis game during which they stunk up <span class='empty' id='32' /> joint both with their pass protection and run blocking.</p><p>Ever since that game, I've been saying that <span class='empty' id='33' /> Saints will only go as far as their offensive line leads them. They were too inconsistent last season and during <span class='empty' id='34' /> first half of this season, especially considering they have what is considered <span class='empty' id='35' /> best guard tandem in <span class='empty' id='36' /> NFL in Pro Bowlers Nicks and Jahri Evans.</p><p>Now it looks like these guys are on a mission. They were terrific Monday night on passing plays against a vaunted Giants defensive line that began <span class='empty' id='37' /> week tied for first in <span class='empty' id='38' /> NFL with 31 sacks. <span class='empty' id='39' /> line was also great on running plays (6.8 yards per carry) and in <span class='empty' id='40' /> screen game, which was highlighted by a classic 24-yard gain by tailback Pierre Thomas in <span class='empty' id='41' /> third quarter.</p><p>HOW <span class='empty' id='42' /> GAME WAS WON</p><p><span class='empty' id='43' /> Saints were spectacular on offense Monday and are on pace for 7,194 yards this season, which would break <span class='empty' id='44' /> NFL record of 7,075 set by <span class='empty' id='45' /> St. Louis Rams in 2000. Quarterback Drew Brees, who threw for 363 yards and four touchdowns, is on pace to shatter Dan Marino's record of 5,084 yards, set in 1984. Brees is on pace for 5,366.</p><p>This game was <span class='empty' id='46' /> best evidence to date that NBC analyst and former Indianapolis Colts Coach Tony Dungy was correct when he told me Sunday that <span class='empty' id='47' /> Saints can be Super Bowl contenders because their offense is even better now than it was in 2009, because of <span class='empty' id='48' /> emergence of tight end Jimmy Graham and tailback Darren Sproles.</p><p>"I really think they can go a long way, " Dungy said of <span class='empty' id='49' /> 8-3 Saints, who are third in <span class='empty' id='50' /> NFC behind <span class='empty' id='51' /> Green Bay Packers (11-0) and San Francisco 49ers (9-2). "I was a little concerned about their defense early in <span class='empty' id='52' /> year, but I think they're better off now. And that offense has such a quick-strike capability that any game they play, you can't count them out. Everybody's looking at Green Bay and San Francisco, I think because of their records. But New Orleans has <span class='empty' id='53' /> ability to win a game against anybody they play."</p><p><span class='empty' id='54' /> Saints' rushing game was also terrific Monday. They ran for 205 yards on 30 carries, including touchdown runs by Thomas, Mark Ingram and Brees.</p><p>By <span class='empty' id='55' /> way, I know that will lead some fans to point out how well <span class='empty' id='56' /> Saints do when they run <span class='empty' id='57' /> ball more. But I can't resist noting that <span class='empty' id='58' /> Saints were still a pass-first team Monday. By <span class='empty' id='59' /> time they jumped to a 35-10 lead in <span class='empty' id='60' /> third quarter, they had thrown <span class='empty' id='61' /> ball 33 times for 359 yards and run <span class='empty' id='62' /> ball 17 times for 102 yards. That's a perfect balance for <span class='empty' id='63' /> way they play offense. They don't need to run <span class='empty' id='64' /> ball more often -- just more efficiently.</p>
