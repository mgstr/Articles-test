Although the New Orleans Saints' offense put up a whopping 577 yards in their 49-24 victory over the New York Giants on Monday night, the game's biggest play came courtesy of a very unlikely suspect: backup linebacker Will Herring.

Herring made a terrific interception in the end zone to snuff out the Giants' first drive when the game was scoreless. New York tight end Jake Ballard had a step on Herring, but quarterback Eli Manning didn't have enough steam on his pass, and Herring reached up to snag it.

It was just the sixth interception and 10th takeaway of the season for the Saints' defense, which entered the game ranked last in the NFL in both categories. Later in the game, Saints cornerback Tracy Porter forced a fumble that was recovered by safety Roman Harper. The Saints also forced three other fumbles that were recovered by the Giants.

Herring's play made the biggest impact when momentum was still up for grabs. The Saints' opening drive had ended with a deflating fake field-goal attempt that fell 2 yards short. Then the Giants nearly marched 90 yards for a quick touchdown before Herring got in the way.
